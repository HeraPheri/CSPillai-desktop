            Introducing three invest②exit type venture building schemes,
            alongside Gootycart (an e-Marketplace), that contain many possible
            offerings and deliveries. It is your opportunity to engage, fund,
            and own the ventures, to gain wealth multi-fold and fulfill your
            passion.

            Our venture buyers are Corporate Venture Capital (CVC) firms, and
            other big companies, chasing after new opportunities to achieve
            strategic and financial goals. You put in the pre-seed and get the
            ventures built based on their Corporate Innovations(CI) and exit
            selling them for a significant financial gain.

          <p>
            Our venture buyers are VC firms and angel investors interested in
            Scalable Startups(SS) and premium exits. You put in the pre-seed and
            get the ventures developed for buyers and gain a gratifying
            financial increase via trade sale exits.

          <p>
            Our venture buyers are new Gootycart business owners and other
            aspiring business individuals who desire to own small cash cow
            ventures. By investing a small amount, you can build Small
            Businesses (SB), mainly digital or service enterprises, and achieve
            decent trade sale exit gains within a short timeframe.

        <p>
          Gootycart is our new Business Model Innovation, an e-Marketplace that
          glorifies and complements the three schemes above. To the buyers, it's
          more than just an e-Marketplace. On Gootycart, anyone can sell their
          innovative (digital or physical) goods without any entry fee and have
          access to free business development, marketing, drop-shipping, product
          return, customer-care, and manufacturing support. A world-class,
          professionally designed online storefront would be handed over to them
          for free upon registering. If desired, Gootycart managers can manage
          their online stores and conduct their businesses for a small fee. The
          advantage of this is to help them maximize their time efficiency and
          focus on expanding their product portfolio. If they do not have a
          product or a service necessary to open a store on Gootycart, csPILLAI
          will help them own a product or a service quickly and inexpensively.
          Gootycart operates as a social enterprise/brand; all Gootycart profits
          would be spent creating optimal conditions or environments to carve an
          easier path for Women entrepreneurs-Rural[We-R] and rural development.

            These are just a few of the many ventures we built alongside
            respective investors. The co-owners, pre-seed investors [PIs],
            attached themselves to these startups from the beginning and
            consistently enjoyed the value and impact of their creation. These
            investors saw ideas that had huge profit potential, took the risk,
            and put down the capital. The results were significant exit gains in
            540 days! Thanks to the buzz created by the 'Industrialized
            Closed-loop venture building ecosystem' (through email marketing,
            press releases, news coverages, blog posts, trade shows, social
            media posts, introductions, online ads, investment guide
            distribution, and Gootycart), and the investors' network strength.
